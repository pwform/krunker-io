# Krunker.io Aimbot & ESP

Aimbot and ESP for Krunker.io with no ADs.

## What's Aimbot:
It's an Aim Assistant that locks the aim to the nearest player. Doesn't auto-shoot, so you have to shoot yourself.

## What's ESP?
Shows players behind walls. It can also show a line between you and them. Good for knowing if there are any players behind you.
